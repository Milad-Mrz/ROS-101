# ROS-101
Let's learn ROS together

ROS (Robot Operating System) is a software framework that provides libraries and tools to help developers build robotics applications. ROS2 is the latest version of ROS, and it offers several improvements over ROS1.

Some of the advantages of ROS2 over ROS1 include:

1. Improved performance: ROS2 has been optimized for performance, with a focus on real-time communication and low latency. This makes it well-suited for use in robotics applications that require fast and reliable communication between software components.

2. Enhanced security: ROS2 introduces a number of security features, such as support for Transport Layer Security (TLS) and access control policies, which can help protect against cyber attacks and ensure the integrity of data transmitted over the network.

3. Improved scalability: ROS2 has been designed to support large-scale systems, with support for distributed computing and cloud integration. This allows for the development of robotics applications that can operate across multiple devices and locations.

4. Enhanced support for multi-robot systems: ROS2 includes improved support for coordinating the actions of multiple robots, allowing for the development of more complex and sophisticated multi-robot systems.

5. New programming languages: ROS2 supports a wider range of programming languages, including C++, Python, and Java, which can make it easier for developers to integrate ROS into their existing workflow.

Overall, ROS2 is a powerful software platform that can help developers build advanced robotics applications with improved performance, security, scalability, and support for multi-robot systems.
